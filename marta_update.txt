shell runs builtins now. pwd, cd, echo, env, and exit all work for real.  
export and unset are just stubs for now.  
need your help with env handling.

---

what works
- echo: prints text, supports -n  
- pwd: shows current directory  
- cd: changes directories, defaults to home  
- env: prints all environment variables  
- exit: exits properly, errors like bash  

what’s half-done
- export: only lists vars, doesn’t change them  
- unset: stub, doesn’t crash  

---

files changed
new:
- src/builtin/env_utils.c — env helpers  
- src/builtin/exit_export.c — exit, export, unset  

modified:
- src/builtin/builtin.c — routes commands  
- src/builtin/echo_cd_pwd.c — builtins code  
- src/main.c — actually runs commands now  
- include/minishell.h — new declarations  
- makefile — added new files  

---

what’s next
- external commands (ls, cat, etc.) with fork/execve  
- pipes and redirections  
- signals (ctrl-c, etc.)  
- variable expansion ($path, $?)  
- finish export/unset logic  
- add cd -

help needed: env handling
need some help with the env stuff for builtins.

export and unset work as basic stubs but don’t modify the environment yet.  
the problem is envp from main() is read-only, so we can’t change it directly.

what we need:
- env manager lel 

i started on helper functions (set_env_var, unset_env_var) but wanna make sure it fits with how everything’s structured.  
we’ll also need this env copy later for variable expansion ($path, $home, etc)
