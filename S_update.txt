what works
- Variable expansion for $USER, $HOME and other environment variables.
- Quoting system: single quotes prevent expansion, double quotes allow it.

what’s half-done
- $? expansion (currently recognized but exit status handling still incomplete).

what changed
- main.c:       Split main loop into a separate function (minishell_loop).
- debug.c:      Added a new file for printing tokens and command structures.
- lexer:        Updated to differentiate STRING_SQUOTE and STRING_DQUOTE tokens.
- parser:       Updated to handle the new token types correctly.
- expander:     Implemented variable expansion
- builtin.c:    Added safety check for NULL command before is_builtin().
- memory:       Fixed a small memory leak in parse_redirect()

what’s next
env handling
